Example
python
Copy code
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

result_add = add(5, 3)
print("5 + 3 =", result_add)  # Output: 5 + 3 = 8

result_subtract = subtract(10, 4)
print("10 - 4 =", result_subtract)  # Output: 10 - 4 = 6

result_multiply = multiply(6, 7)
print("6 * 7 =", result_multiply)  # Output: 6 * 7 = 42

result_divide = divide(8, 2)
print("8 / 2 =", result_divide)  # Output: 8 / 2 = 4.0
